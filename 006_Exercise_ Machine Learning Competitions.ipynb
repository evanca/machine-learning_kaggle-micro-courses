You can then improve your model (e.g. by adding features) to improve and see how you stack up to others taking this micro-course.\n\nThe steps in this notebook are:\n1. Build a Random Forest model with all of your data (**X** and **y**)\n2. Read in the \"test\" data, which doesn't include values for the target.  Predict home values in the test data with your Random Forest model.\n3. Submit those predictions to the competition and see your score.\n4. Optionally, come back to see if you can improve your model by adding features or changing your model. Then you can resubmit to see how that stacks up on the competition leaderboard."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Recap\nHere's the code you've written so far.

Look at the list of columns and think about what might affect home prices.  Some features will cause errors because of issues like missing values or non-numeric data types. \n\nThe [Intermediate Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intermediate-machine-learning) micro-course will teach you how to handle these types of features. You will also learn to use **xgboost**, a technique giving even better accuracy than Random Forest.\n\n\n# Other Micro-Courses\nThe **[Pandas Micro-Course](https://kaggle.com/Learn/Pandas)** will give you the data manipulation skills to quickly go from conceptual idea to implementation in your data science projects. \n\nYou are also ready for the **[Deep Learning](https://kaggle.com/Learn/Deep-Learning)** micro-course, where you will build models with better-than-human level performance at computer vision tasks."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---\n**[Machine Learning Micro-Course Home Page](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning)**\n\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
